It’s a cool website that shows different personal websites people have made for themselves. I find it cool because **you can see the different design choices they made and take inspiration from them.**

I found the website to be very interesting and quite inspiring. I was personally trying to find different web developer portfolios for inspiration that this website was just what I needed!
